        <p>But the question remains: why do you want to nail sharing all this information? The reason is simple: you want to take your audience backstage to show them you are human and tell them you are worth trusting (and, therefore, buy from).

            Think of it like this: would you rather buy from a business you know nothing about or would you deal with someone with a friendly face shared on their About page and a story that you find inspiring? I’m willing to bet you’d work with the latter. Isn’t it?
            
            An excellent About page not only narrates your story, values, and gives an inside look into how your business came to be, but it also helps sell. When prospects learn your story and connect with it, they’re likely to buy from you. A well-planned About Us page can do all this!</p>
